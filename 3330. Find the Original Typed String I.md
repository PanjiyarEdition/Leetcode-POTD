# 📍Description ➡:-
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this at most once.

You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type.


# 📝Code ⬇:-


# Java
```java []
class Solution {
        public int possibleStringCount(String word) {
        int n = word.length(), res = n;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            if (word.charAt(i) != word.charAt(i - 1))
                res--;
        return res;
       
    }
}

```

# C++
``` cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int possibleStringCount(string word) {
        int n = word.length();
        int count = n;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (word[i] != word[i - 1]) {
                count--;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

# Python
``` python []
class Solution:
    def possibleStringCount(self, word: str) -> int:
        n = len(word)
        count = n
        for i in range(1, n):
            if word[i] != word[i - 1]:
                count -= 1
        return count    
```
