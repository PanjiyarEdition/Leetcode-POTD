# üìçDescription ‚û°:-
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
You are given a string `s`.

You can perform the following process on `s` any number of times:

Choose an index i in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index i that is equal to `s[i],` and at least one character to the right that is also equal to `s[i]`.
Delete the closest character to the left of index i that is equal to `s[i].`
Delete the closest character to the right of index i that is equal to `s[i].`
Return the minimum length of the final string `s `that you can achieve.

            charFrequency[c - 'a']++;
