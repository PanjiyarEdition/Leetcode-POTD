# 📍Description ➡:-
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
There are `several consecutive` houses along a street, each of which has some money inside. There is also a `robber`, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he refuses to steal from adjacent homes.

The capability of the `robber` is the `maximum amount` of money he steals from one house of all the houses he robbed.

You are given an integer `array nums` representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the ith house from the left has `nums[i]` dollars.

You are also given an `integer k`, representing the minimum number of houses the `robber` will steal from. It is always possible to steal at `least k` houses.

Return the minimum capability of the `robber` out of all the possible ways to steal at `least k` houses.
