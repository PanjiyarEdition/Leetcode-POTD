# 📍Description ➡:-
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
There exists an infinitely large `two-dimensional` grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a `positive integer n`, indicating that you must do the following routine for `n minutes`:

At the `first minute`, color any arbitrary unit `cell blue`.
Every minute thereafter, color `blue every uncolored` cell that touches a blue cell.
Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after `minutes 1, 2, and 3`.


# 📝Code ⬇:-


# Java
```java []
class Solution {
    public long coloredCells(int n) {
        long count = 1;
        n--;
        while (n > 0) {
            count += n * 4;
            n--;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

```

# C++
``` cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    long long coloredCells(int n) {
        long long count = 1;
        n--;
        while(n > 0){
            count += n * 4;
            n--;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

# Python
``` python []
class Solution:
    def coloredCells(self, n: int) -> int:
        return 2*n*(n-1)+1     
```
