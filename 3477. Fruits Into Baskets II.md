# 📍Description ➡:-
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n, where fruits[i] represents the quantity of the ith type of fruit, and baskets[j] represents the capacity of the jth basket.

From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:

Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.
Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.
Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

# Java
```java []
class Solution {
    public int numOfUnplacedFruits(int[] fruits, int[] baskets) {
        int n = fruits.length;
        boolean[] used = new boolean[n];
        int unplaced = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            boolean placed = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (!used[j] && baskets[j] >= fruits[i]) {
                    used[j] = true;
                    placed = true;
                    break;
