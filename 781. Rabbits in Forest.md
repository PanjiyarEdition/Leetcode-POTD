# 📍Description ➡:-
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
There is a `forest` with an unknown number of `rabbits`. We asked n rabbits "How many rabbits have the `same color` as you?" and collected the answers in an integer array answers where `answers[i]` is the answer of the ith rabbit.

Given the array answers, return the `minimum number` of `rabbits` that could be in the forest.


# 📝Code ⬇:-


# Java
```java []
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int numRabbits(int[] answers) {
        Arrays.sort(answers);
        int res = 0, count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < answers.length; i++) {
            if (answers[i] == 0) {
                res++;  
            } else if (i == 0 || answers[i] != answers[i - 1] || count == 0) {
                res += answers[i] + 1;  
                count = answers[i];
            } else {
                count--;  
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```

# C++
``` cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers) {
        sort(answers.begin(), answers.end());
        int res = 0, count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < answers.size(); ++i) {
            if (answers[i] == 0) {
                res++;  // 🐇 
            } else if (i == 0 || answers[i] != answers[i - 1] || count == 0) {
                res += answers[i] + 1;  
                count = answers[i];   
            } else {
                count--; 
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

# Python
``` python []
class Solution:
    def numRabbits(self, answers: List[int]) -> int:
        d = {}
        count = 0
        for i in answers:
		# add 1 if rabbit says 0 other rabbits have same color
            if i == 0:
                count+=1
            else:
			# check if i is present in dictionary or not 
			# and also check whether the frequency of i and value of i is same or not
			# For example [2,2,2] and [2,2] has the same result (i.e) 3 but [2,2,2,2] should            
			# be seperated into two groups and the result will be 6
            # So we are again initializing the i value to 0
                if i not in d or i == d[i]:
                    d[i] = 0
                    count+=1 + i
                else:
                    d[i] += 1
                    
        return count
