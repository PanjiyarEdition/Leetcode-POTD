# 📍Description ➡:-
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
You are given three integers x, y, and z, representing the positions of three people on a number line:

x is the position of Person 1.
y is the position of Person 2.
z is the position of Person 3, who does not move.
Both Person 1 and Person 2 move toward Person 3 at the same speed.

Determine which person reaches Person 3 first:

Return 1 if Person 1 arrives first.
Return 2 if Person 2 arrives first.
Return 0 if both arrive at the same time.
Return the result accordingly.


# 📝Code ⬇:-


# Java
```java []
class Solution {
    public int findClosest(int x, int y, int z) {
        int d = (x - y) * (x + y - 2 * z);
        return (d > 0 ? 2 : 0) | (d < 0 ? 1 : 0);
    }
}

```

# C++
``` cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int findClosest(int x, int y, int z) {
        int d=x*x-y*y-2*z*(x-y);
        return (d==0)?0:1<<(d>0);
    }
};
```

# Python
``` python []
class Solution:
    def findClosest(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int:
        d = (x - y) * (x + y - 2 * z)
        return (d > 0) << 1 | (d < 0)    
```
